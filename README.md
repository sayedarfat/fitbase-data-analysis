# Combined Metrics Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes user fitness and activity metrics to gain insights into their activity levels, fitness progress, and overall health trends.

### Key Data Points:
- **Id**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **ActiveDays**: Total number of days the user was active.
- **ActivityLevel**: Categorization of the user's activity level (e.g., Active, Beginner).
- **MeanSteps**: Average number of steps taken per day.
- **FitnessLevel**: The user's fitness level, indicating their overall fitness (e.g., Pro, Beginner).
- **TotalSteps**: The total number of steps taken during the recorded period.
- **TotalCalories**: The total number of calories burned.
- **TotalActiveMinutes**: The total number of active minutes logged.

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**: The data in `combined_metrics.csv` can be used to analyze user activity and fitness levels. You can perform descriptive statistics, trend analysis, or machine learning predictions to further understand user behavior.
2. **Customization**: The data can be filtered or grouped by specific columns such as `ActivityLevel` or `FitnessLevel` to get insights into different user segments.
3. **Visualization**: The data is well-suited for visualization, allowing you to create charts and graphs to depict trends over time or comparisons between different user groups.

## Project Structure

- **`combined_metrics.csv`**: Contains the raw data with user fitness and activity metrics.
- **README.md**: This file contains the project overview, data description, and usage instructions.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of data analysis techniques.
- A tool like Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), or R to analyze and visualize the data.
